Welcome to **<font size="+2">RSE@SU</font>** - the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Group at <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za/english">Stellenbosch University</a>.

RSE@SU has the distinction of being **the first dedicated RSE Group in Africa** (offering Research Software Engineering services to researchers across all Faculties and Schools within the university).<br>
<br>

<details><summary>What is an RSE?</summary>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term <b><a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/research-software-engineers">'Research Software Engineer' (RSE)</a></b> was coined by the UK-based Software Sustainability Institute in 2012, on the recognition that research is increasingly dependent on software, and that such software requires "people who <a href="https://researchsoftware.org/"><b>combine professional software expertise with an understanding of research</b></a>".</p>   

<p>Skilled RSEs support researchers in fulfilling the expectations from funders for Open Science, and funders are increasingly requiring the involvement of RSEs in data- and computationally-intensive research.</p>

<p>The important innovation of <a href="https://society-rse.org/community/rse-groups/">RSE Groups</a> established by leading UK universities pioneered <b>a novel platform to make RSE skills more widely available.</b></p>

<details><summary>What do RSEs do?</summary>
<p>
<blockquote>
   
<p>RSEs provide support to researchers (and external clients) with services ranging from <b><a href="https://k-c-martin.github.io/test-page-2/#consulting">training</a></b>, <b><a href="https://k-c-martin.github.io/test-page-2/#consulting">consultancy</a></b>, and <b><a href="https://k-c-martin.github.io/test-page-2/#consulting">custom code development (or rehabilitation)</a></b>.</p>

<p>RSEs assist researchers to <b>'tidy up' code in preparation for publication</b> (with code-sharing increasingly important to credibility), and help researchers establish good practices (teaching and supporting adoption of <b>collaborative version control, sustainable code development, and appropriate licensing</b>).</p>

<p>RSEs support researchers to <b>progressively transition to increasingly sophisticated levels of computational work, and explore cutting-edge technologies</b>: e.g. starting from simple scripts on a single laptop, towards reproducible analysis pipelines and HPC- or cloud-enabled Big Data analyses, simulations, or deployment of AI/ML models.</p>

<p>RSEs can work with researchers to <b>develop high-impact grant proposals</b> that leverage the advantages of software engineering in computational research, increasing the prospects of success at both the award and execution stages.</p>

## How can RSE@SU help you?

### Training

<a href="https://carpentries.org/">**The Carpentries**</a> (Software / Data / Library Carpentry) is a non-profit dedicated to volunteer-driven development and dissemination of coding-related lessons to researchers (with certified Instructors); **RSE@SU staff are able to provide Carpentries workshops to Stellenbosch University staff and students**, and can provide extended workshops to promote use of the university's High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities.

### Consulting

Dr Martin is a [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) International Fellow](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/kim-martin), and has been awarded SSI funding to conduct a pilot program whereby 8-12 Stellenbosch University researchers will be provided with targeted consultations from UK-based RSEs, with the aim of developing RSE-related components to potentially include in existing or future grant applications (note that consultations will not form a 'full grant writing assistance' program). **This program will supplement consultations ordinarily provided by RSE@SU staff.**

### Coding

RSE@SU capacity and capability to **provide software engineering support** is extensible given the 'Affiliated RSE@SU Member' (ARM) model the group employs, whereby Core Staff collaborate with Members (Academic and Technical) depending on the expertise required.

In addition to conventional software engineering, RSE@SU provides access to **special expertise in hardware (e.g. wireless sensors and automation)** via collaboration with Professor Thinus Booysen (Chair of IoT at Stellenbosch University).
